abstract: Managing a library collection requires consistency and meticulous attention
  to detail, but managing remotely requires even more of these skills as well as a
  strong team that can work together to get the job done. Unlike reference and research
  services, technical services duties are routine and standard across locations, which
  function very smoothly with a bit of centralization and procedural discipline. While
  there are idiosyncrasies at individual libraries, this article covers seven areas
  that affect the success of collection management in a remote work situation.
