abstract: "Managing a library collection requires consistency and meticulous attention to detail, but managing remotely requires even more of these skills as well as a strong team that can work together to get the job done. Unlike reference and research services, technical services duties are routine and standard across locations, which function very smoothly with a bit of centralization and procedural discipline. While there are idiosyncrasies at individual libraries, this article covers seven areas that affect the success of collection management in a remote work situation."
