abstract: The distribution of scholarly content today happens in the context of an
  immense deluge of information found on the internet. As a result, researchers face
  serious challenges when archiving and finding information that relates to their
  work. Library science principles provide a framework for navigating information
  ecosystems in order to help researchers improve findability of their professional
  output. Here, we describe the information ecosystem which consists of users, context,
  and content, all 3 of which must be addressed to make information findable and usable.
  We provide a set of tips that can help researchers evaluate who their users are,
  how to archive their research outputs to encourage findability, and how to leverage
  structural elements of software to make it easier to find information within and
  beyond their publications. As scholars evaluate their research communication strategies,
  they can use these steps to improve how their research is discovered and reused.
