abstract: 'If you attended SLA''s recent 2015 Lawmaggedon webinar, you may have heard
  Jean O''Grady reference the term ''anecdata'' â€” usage data based on the anecdotal,
  in the absence of any hard (or soft) usage data. I have seen the anecdotal trump
  data over the years: most notably a strong protest against a cancellation, only
  to find a thick layer of dust in front of the item in question.'
