abstract: "Soon after starting a new position as a librarian at
a data science software company, I saw that my
employer was offering a workshop to learn how to
do machine learning in the R programming language
and I jumped at the chance to learn more about
the subject. With support from my boss, I struggled
through October and November refreshing my linear
regression knowledge (knowledge I’d happily left
behind in high school) and bringing my coding skills
from near zero to “won’t be embarrassed in front of
my colleagues."
