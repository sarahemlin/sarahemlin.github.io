abstract: Data science brings opportunities to work more quickly and easily with data.
  It provides better reporting formats by incorporating outside data from various
  sources, and can even turn text into data that can be displayed visually. Even though
  legal information isnâ€™t always associated with data, science, or data science, data
  science skills enable law librarians to do their jobs with greater efficiency. With
  data science skills, we are able to show new value for our teams and organizations,
  so it is definitely worth the time invested.  The following 10 data science skills
  and techniques, along with descriptions of the amazing deliverables that are associated
  with them, are listed in a progressive skill-building sequence.
