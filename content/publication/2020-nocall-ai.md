abstract: 'Soon after starting a new position as a librarian at a data science software
  company, I saw that my employer was offering a workshop to learn how to do machine
  learning in the R programming language and I jumped at the chance to learn more
  about the subject. With support from my boss, I struggled through October and November
  refreshing my linear regression knowledge (knowledge I’d happily left behind in
  high school) and bringing my coding skills from near zero to  “won’t be embarrassed
  in front of my colleagues.” '
