abstract: Acquisitions is the central part of a technical services department, yet
  at some libraries not all technical services duties are performed by employees.
  Working with outsourced technical services staff has enabled us to maintain service
  levels without our budget. For other libraries in the same situation (or considering
  such a move), it is well worth the time spent to carefully consider all aspects
  of the duties and staff involved, as well as which vendor relationships may or may
  not be affected.
