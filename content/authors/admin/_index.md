Sarah Lin is currently the Information Architect & Digital Librarian at RStudio, a data science software company. She has previously been a bindery clerk, a serials librarian, an indexer, a technical services librarian and a content manager in academic, medical, legal and corporate libraries. Sarah believes that data literacy is the key to the future and that technical services librarians are the natural standard-bearers of this movement in the library community.
