abstract: Data science is everywhere these days, but what exactly is it? How do you "do data science"? Is it something law librarians could or should learn? What relationship, if any, is there between data science and artificial intelligence? Is data science only for Big Data? As individuals, we are consumers of data science in all aspects of our lives and our profession lives are no different. This session will explain what data science is, how it is done and how it relates to hot topics Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. Attendees will understand how data science is relevant to their jobs--how it is used in empirical legal research, to optimize the business of law, and that it underpins current legal research products. Resources for learning data science skills will be included.
