abstract: The standard library school cliche is that we went so we didn't have to
  do any math! Yet with machine learning, deep learning, algorithms, text mining,
  programming languages, data science, data encoding, data transfer, and linked data
  pervasive in our personal and professional environments, our career futures hinge
  on our computational skillsâ€”skills we might think we don't have (or don't want to
  have). This session suggests that Technical Services (TS) librarians, in particular,
  need to transform their thinking on this issue, and guides them through the process
  of realizing they are already doing most of these things. Data science is a good
  example of basic skills TS librarians are already primed with; translating those
  fundamentals into data science methodologies will transform data manipulation and
  analysis in libraries. Armed with confidence, attendees will leave ready to fill
  in the knowledge gaps they do have to be the best caretakers and advocates for their
  libraries' data.
