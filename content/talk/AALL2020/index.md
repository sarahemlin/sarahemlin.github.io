abstract: THIS EVENT WAS CANCELLED DUE TO COVID-19. The digital humanities have been
  engaged in sentiment analysis for quite some time. However, there is little work
  being done in this area with legal bibliography. This session will cover the basic
  tools used for sentiment analysis, how to use them, and whether there was a statistically
  significant shift in legal scholarship following the 2008 financial crisis and the
  2016 presidential election.  David Holt (UC-Davis) will moderate, I will present
  the R portion, and John Beatty (SUNY-Buffalo) and Jason Eiseman (Yale) will present
  the Python portion of the Deep Dive.
