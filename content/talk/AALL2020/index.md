abstract: 	The digital humanities have been engaged in sentiment analysis for quite some time. However, there is little work being done in this area with legal bibliography. This session will cover the basic tools used for sentiment analysis, how to use them, and whether there was a statistically significant shift in legal scholarship following the 2008 financial crisis and the 2016 presidential election.  David Holt (UC-Davis) will moderate, I will present the R portion, and John Beatty (SUNY-Buffalo) and Jason Eiseman (Yale) will present the Python portion of the Deep Dive.
