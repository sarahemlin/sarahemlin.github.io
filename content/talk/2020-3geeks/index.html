abstract: Sarah discusses what the R Programming language does, and how she got interested
  in the profession of statistical computing. While some may not see a direct link
  between being a law librarian and an R programmer, there are actually a number of
  skills librarians possess which make them well suited for data analytics. One skill
  is our ability to understand, clean, and organize information. For RStudios, the
  Chief Scientist, Hadley Wickam created Tidyverse which helps in handling the clean
  data tasks. And there are also resources like Shinyapps.io to help organize. Throw
  in a law librarian to have it all make sense and tell a story and you have a fantastic
  combination of skills and tools. And we should mention that it is free open-source
  software.
